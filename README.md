# MLAI
## This repo consists of real world usecases which can be solved using Machine learning concepts. All of these have been made to run using Python, Pandas, SKLearn, Dataframes. All the use cases in this Repo were done as part of my Post graduate program in Machine Learning.
Reason for choosing Pandas, Python: The data I was able to collect didnt require to run at a distributed mode. This can very eaily be translated to run Pyspark and using Spark MLLIB and run the same algorithm on huge volumes of data
